Merging two sorted tasks is a prerequisite for merge sort and other merge based algorithms.
```
arr1[] = {1,3,4,5}, arr2[] = {2,4,6,8}
arr3[] = {arr1[], arr2[]}
	   = {1,2,3,4,4,5,6,8}
```
The brute force approach to merging is to insert all the elements of both the arrays into a final array and then sorting the array in the end.
