Developed by James Golsing in 1995. Firstly called **Greentalk** with file extension `.gt`. After that it was called **Oak**. Finally it was named **Java** because of trademark by Oak Technologies.

# Features of Java
Primary objective of Java was to be portable and simple.
There are a list of features of Java:
1. **Simple:** Easy to learn and syntax is similar to C++
2. **Object Oriented:** Java organizes the software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behaviour
3. Portable
4. **Platform Independent:** It is write once, run anywhere. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is platform-independent and can run on multiple platforms.
5. **Secured:** Java is best known for security. It has no explicit pointer and Java programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
6. **Robust:** It has strong memory management. Lack of pointers avoids security problems. It has automatic garbage collection. It also has exception handling and type checking mechanism.
7. **Architecture Neutral:** It is so because there are no implementation dependent features, for example size of primitive types is fixed.
8. Interpreted
9. High Performance
10. Multithreaded
11. Distributed
12. Dynamic
