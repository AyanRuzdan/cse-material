# Selection Sort
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending sort order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm contains two subarrays:
* Already sorted subarray
* Remaining unsorted subarray

In every iteration, the minimum element (considering ascending sort order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
