# The Role of Algorithms in Computing
## Algorithms
An **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or a set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or a set of values, as **output**.
It can be viewed as a toll for solving a well-specifed ***computational problem***.
In general, an ***instance of a problem*** consists of the input needed to compute a solution to the problem.
An algorithm is said to be **correct** if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output. We say that a correct algorithm ***solves*** the given computational problem.
Incorrect algorithms can also be useful, if we control their error rate.
