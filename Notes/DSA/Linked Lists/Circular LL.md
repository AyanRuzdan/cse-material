## ðŸ“š Standard Interview Questions (Conceptual + Coding)

### 1. **Basics & Construction**

-  Create a Circular Linked List
    
-  Traverse and Print a Circular Linked List
    
-  Convert a Singly Linked List to a Circular Linked List
    

### 2. **Insertion/Deletion**

-  Insert at the beginning of a Circular Linked List
    
-  Insert at the end of a Circular Linked List
    
-  Delete a node from the beginning
    
-  Delete a node from the end
    
-  Delete a node with a given key
    
-  Insert/Delete at a given position
    

### 3. **Cycle Detection & Applications**

-  Detect loop in a linked list (Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection â€” Leetcode 141)
    
-  Find starting point of loop (Leetcode 142)
    
-  Length of loop
    
-  Remove loop in a linked list
    
-  Check if a linked list is circular (GFG)
    
-  Find the node where two circular linked lists intersect (if they do)
    

### 4. **Josephus Problem (Classic)**

-  Josephus Problem using Circular Linked List (GFG, Leetcode variant)
    
    > Problem: n people in a circle, every k-th person is eliminated until one remains.
    

### 5. **Advanced / Tricky**

-  Sort a Circular Linked List
    
-  Split a Circular Linked List into two halves (GFG)
    
-  Merge two sorted Circular Linked Lists
    
-  Find the middle of a Circular Linked List (slow-fast pointer with care)
    
-  Check if two circular linked lists are identical
