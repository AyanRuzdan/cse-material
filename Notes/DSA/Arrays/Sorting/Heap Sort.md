# Heap Sort
**Time Complexity: $O(nlogn)$**
Heap sort uses the heap data structure to keep the min/max element at the top of the heap, which is then swapped with the last element of the heap in the list form. Then the heap size is reduced by one and then the heap is heapified again. Iteratively the top element is put in the sorted portion of the list, and the unsorted list is heapified.
