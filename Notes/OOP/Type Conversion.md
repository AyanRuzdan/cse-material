# Unit 4 (contd.)
> Type conversion means converting a data type from one to another.

### Automatic Type Conversion
The C++ compiler does automatic type conversion to the data type that is more fitting.
There are 4 types of data conversion
* Basic to Basic
* Basic to Class
* Class to Basic
* Class to Class
### Basic to Basic
This is the type of conversion we normally see.
```cpp
int x;
float y=12.345;
x=y; //float is converted to int
```
### Basic to Class
