# 1. Algorithms
Informally, and _algorithm_ is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as _input_ and produces some value, or set of values, as _output_. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.
An algorithm is said to be _correct_ if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output. We say that a correct algorithm _solves_ the given computational problem. An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some input instances, or it might halt with an incorrect answer. Contrary to what one might expect, incorrect algorithms can sometimes be useful, if we can control their error rate.
An algorithm can be specified in English, as a computer program, or even as hardware design. The only requirement is that the specification must provide a precise description of the computational procedure to be followed.
