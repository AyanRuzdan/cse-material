## Problem Statement
A traffic light at the turn for the “MEGA” shopping center from the Novomoskovskiy highway works in such a way that _k_ cars are able to take a turn in one minute. At weekends all the residents of the city drive to the mall to take a shopping, which results in a huge traffic jam at the turn. Administration of the mall ordered to install a camera at the nearby bridge, which is able to calculate the number of cars approaching this turn from the city. The observation started _n_ minutes ago. You should use the data from the camera to determine the number of cars currently standing in the traffic jam.

### Input

The first line contains integers _k_ and _n_ (1 ≤ _k_, _n_ ≤ 100), which are the number of cars that can take a turn to “MEGA” in one minute and the number of minutes passed from the beginning of observation. The second line contains space-separated integers $a_1, \dots, a_n$ (0 <= a_i <= 100), where $a_i$ is the number of cars that approached the turn during the $i-th$ minute. The observation started at morning, when there were no cars at the turn.

### Output

Output the number of cars currently standing in the traffic jam.

    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int n, k;
    cin >> k >> n;
    int total = 0, aux;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> aux;
        total += aux;
        total = max(0, total - k);
    }
    cout << total;
    return 0;
}
